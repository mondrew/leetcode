# Description
A forest is represented with a hashmap. 

This hashmap has this key -> value relationship: child -> parent.

Every node has a unique integer element.

You need to find out the largest tree's root node.

If there is a tie, return the smallest root.

The tree with the highest number of nodes, is the largest one. The edges are directed from parent to child.
